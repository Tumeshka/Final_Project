Summary of changes in the value chain links from the July 2024 version to September 2025

The downstream value chain links have been updated:

   •   The EXIOBASE final demand categories Final consumption expenditure by households, Gross
       fixed capital formation, Final consumption expenditure by non-profit organisations serving
       households (NPISH), Changes in inventories, Final consumption expenditure by government
       are now included in the downstream value chain links under the category Final consumption
       category.
   •   An error has been fixed in the calculation of the downstream value chain links to ensure that
       the links displayed in the file are reflective of the top five value chain links from the Input-
       Output model (based on total output data). 80% of the direct operations activities listed in
       the downstream file have 10 or fewer links. 20% of the direct operations activities are linked
       to between 11 and 35 Tier 1 activities. This results primarily from: 1) the fact that some
       economic activities are supplying to a large number of other activities; and 2) the need to
       convert from EXIOBASE sector classification into ISIC.



Summary of changes to the format of the CSV zip file

   •   In the July 2024 csv files, rows 1 and 2 of the following files contained the headers “Economic
       activity” and “Pressures” or “Ecosystem services dependencies”. The September 2025 csv
       files have the two header rows removed for the following files: 03. Dependency links, 05.
       Pressure links, 06. Dependency mat ratings, 07. Pressure mat ratings.
