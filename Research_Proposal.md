# Cross-Sector Environmental Impact Analysis of Investment Portfolios
## A TNFD-Aligned Assessment Using the ENCORE Framework

---

### Research Question

**How do investment portfolio compositions differentially affect cross-sector economic activities through environmental pressure pathways, and what assessment scopes reveal the most material nature-related risks?**

---

### Background & Motivation

Over 50% of global GDP ($44 trillion) is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its ecosystem services (WEF, 2020). Yet financial institutions remain inadequately equipped to assess how their investments create environmental pressures that cascade across interconnected economic sectors. The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) has established the LEAP framework (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) to address this gap, requiring organizations to identify dependencies and impacts on natural capital.

This research operationalizes the TNFD approach by analyzing how economic activities within investment portfolios generate environmental pressures that degrade ecosystem components, disrupt ecosystem services, and ultimately affect other dependent sectors—creating systemic nature-related risks.

### Methodology

Using the **ENCORE database** (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure), we construct a directed network mapping the flow:

**Source Activity → Environmental Pressures → Ecosystem Components → Ecosystem Services → Affected Activities**

We apply six assessment scopes (presets) aligned with TNFD materiality thresholds:

| Preset | Scope Description |
|--------|-------------------|
| Default | Medium intensity, all pathways |
| Precise Impact | Direct, local, short-term, highest intensity only |
| High Impact | High intensity, direct impacts, high sensitivity |
| Broad View | Low threshold, comprehensive value chain screening |
| Long-term Global | Medium intensity, long-term, global scale |
| High Sensitivity | Focus on highly sensitive ecosystem components |

---

### Key Findings

1. **Most Impactful Source Activities**: Sectors generating the highest environmental pressure scores across all assessment scopes
2. **Most Affected Activities**: Sectors most vulnerable to ecosystem service disruption from cross-sector pressures  
3. **Scope Sensitivity**: How impact rankings shift under different materiality thresholds
4. **Transmission Pathways**: Critical ecosystem services acting as risk transmission channels

### Implications for Sustainable Finance

- **Portfolio Risk Assessment**: Quantifying nature-related exposure across sector allocations
- **TNFD Compliance**: Demonstrating practical application of the LEAP methodology
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Identifying high-leverage intervention points for reducing systemic environmental risk
